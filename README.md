## Developer Setup

### Prerequisites

* [Atlassian Plugin SDK](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/framework/atlassian-sdk/set-up-the-atlassian-plugin-sdk-and-build-a-project/)
* Java 11

Here are the SDK commands you'll use immediately:

* `atlas-run`   -- installs this plugin into the product and starts it on localhost
* `atlas-debug` -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* `atlas-help`  -- prints description for all commands in the SDK

For further details see the full [Atlassian Plugin SDK documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/DOCS/Introduction+to+the+Atlassian+Plugin+SDK).
